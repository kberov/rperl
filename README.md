RPerl
=====

RPerl is the optimizing compiler for the Perl 5 programming language.  RPerl
stands for Restricted Perl, in that we restrict our use of Perl to those parts
which can be made to run fast.

The input to the RPerl compiler is low-magic Perl 5 source code.  RPerl
converts the low-magic Perl 5 source code into C++ source code using Perl
and/or C++ data structures.  Inline::CPP converts the C++ source code into XS
source code.  Perl's XS tools and a standard C++ compiler convert the XS source
code into machine-readable binary code, which can be directly linked back into
normal high-magic Perl 5 source code.  

The output of the RPerl compiler is fast-running binary code that is exactly
equivalent to, and compatible with, the original low-magic Perl 5 source code
input.  The net effect is that RPerl compiles slow low-magic Perl 5 code into
fast binary code, which can optionally be mixed back into high-magic Perl apps.
