This license provision shall be binding on my heirs, assignees, or other successors to the dominating interest, as well as on me.

I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract.  I hereby indemnify and hold harmless Braswell, his heirs, assignees, or other successors and the officers, employees, and agents of any organization controlled or owned in majority by Braswell, against any and all claims, actions or damages (including attorney's reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or alleged breach of the foregoing warranty.
