<<<=== OVERVIEW ===>>>

All RPerl Family software and documentation is legally copyrighted by original
RPerl creator William N. Braswell, Jr.

To maintain the legal integrity and defensibility of the RPerl Family of
software and documentation, all contributors to the RPerl Family must assign
copyright ownership to Mr. Braswell, thereby empowering him to pursue legal
action against those who attempt to violate any RPerl Family copyright,
license, or other intellectual property rights.

This is the same strategy used by the Free Software Foundation for many GNU
software projects, as explained below:

Why The FSF Gets Copyright Assignments From Contributors By Professor Eben
Moglen, Columbia University Law School Copyright Â© 2001, 2008, 2009, 2014 Free
Software Foundation, Inc.  The quoted text below is not modified, and is

"Under US copyright law, which is the law under which most free software
programs have historically been first published, there are very substantial
procedural advantages to registration of copyright.  And despite the broad
right of distribution conveyed by the GPL, enforcement of copyright is
generally not possible for distributors: only the copyright holder or someone
having assignment of the copyright can enforce the license.  If there are
multiple authors of a copyrighted work, successful enforcement depends on
having the cooperation of all authors.

In order to make sure that all of our copyrights can meet the recordkeeping and
other requirements of registration, and in order to be able to enforce the GPL
most effectively, FSF requires that each author of code incorporated in FSF
projects provide a copyright assignment, and, where appropriate, a disclaimer
of any work-for-hire ownership claims by the programmer's employer.  That way
we can be sure that all the code in FSF projects is free code, whose freedom we
can most effectively protect, and therefore on which other developers can
completely rely."

<<<=== COMMITMENT TO FREE & OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE ===>>>

Mr. Braswell is committed to maintaining the free-and-open-source software
(FOSS) basis of the RPerl Family.

If your RPerl Family contribution is accepted and merged into an official RPerl
Family source repository, then your contribution is automatically published on
Github with FOSS licensing, currently the same terms as Perl itself (your
choice of Artistic or GNU GPL licenses).  

<<<=== ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT ===>>>

The file named ASSIGNMENT contains the copyright assignment agreement.  Please
print the file on one page of paper, then use blue ink to clearly write your
full legal name twice (both at the top and bottom), write the date, and sign
your signature.  You may then submit the fully-executed ASSIGNMENT document
either in original paper form via snail mail, or a high-resolution digital
scanned copy via e-mail.  If possible, please execute (sign) the ASSIGNMENT
document in the presence of an official Notary Public, and have them notarize
the appropriate area at the bottom of the document.

<<<=== EMPLOYER DISCLAIMER ===>>>

The file named EMPLOYERS contains the employer disclaimer agreement.  If you
are employed, and either your job involves computer programming or you have
executed an agreement giving your employer rights to the software you create,
then we must also receive a fully-executed copy of the EMPLOYERS file, using
the same blue-ink signing and notarization method as the ASSIGNMENT document
described above.  Please have the EMPLOYERS agreement signed by a vice
president or general manager in your organization.  

<<<=== OTHER CONTRIBUTORS ===>>>

If any other people have written software source code or documentation as part
of your RPerl contribution, then they and their respective employers must also
all sign and submit their own copies of the ASSIGNMENT and EMPLOYERS
agreements.

Please be sure you DO NOT STUDY OR INCLUDE any 3rd-party or public-domain
intellectual property as part of your RPerl contribution, including but not
limited to: source code; documentation; copyrighted, trademarked, or patented
components; or technical concepts.  In other words, don't copy someone else's
work and don't study someone else's work while doing your own.  All your work
must be 100% original.

<<<=== RECOGNITION ===>>>

Once we have received all necessary assignment agreements and employer
disclaimer agreements, then we will begin the process of reviewing any software
pull requests you have submitted through the official RPerl repository on
Github.  Upon merging of your pull request(s), you will automatically be listed
by Github as one of the official RPerl contributors, and you will also be
manually added to the AUTHORS file.

<<<=== SUBMISSION ===>>>

When you are ready to submit the signed agreement(s), please answer the
following 12 questions about yourself and your RPerl contribution, then include
your answers in the body of your e-mail or on a separate sheet of paper in
snail mail, and send it all to one of the addresses below.
